    "## Defining the Project Scope\n",
    "### Time Period Selection\n",
    "- Time Period: March 2020 to December 2020\n",
    "- Reasoning:\n",
    "    - **March 2020**: The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. This period marks the beginning of widespread awareness and significant changes in public behavior and communication patterns.\n",
    "        - [Source Link](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=March%2011%2C%202020,declares%20COVID%2D19%20a%20pandemic.)\n",
    "    - **December 2020**: By the end of 2020, various key events had taken place, including the approval of the first vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) in December.\n",
    "        - [Source Link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/covid-19#:~:text=The%20FDA%20gives,since%20December%202020.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "I chose these months because this period captures the initial pandemic response, lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the beginning of vaccine distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big Picture Hashtag Selection\n",
    "- Hashtags:\n",
    "    - **#COVID19**: broadly covers all content related to COVID-19, ensuring a wide array of public health messages\n",
    "    - **#Coronavirus**: similar to #COVID19 but may capture different audiences or slightly different content\n",
    "    - **#Pandemic**: encompasses the broader impact and responses to the pandemic beyond just the virus itself\n",
    "    - **#StayHome**: reflects public health messaging around lockdowns and staying indoors to prevent the spread\n",
    "    - **#WearAMask**: focuses on wearing masks, which was a crucial public health directive during the pandemic\n",
    "    - **#SocialDistancing**: a term that became commonly used during the pandemic to maintain physical distance in an effort to reduce transmissions\n",
    "    - **#FlattenTheCurve**: this represents early efforts to reduce the infection rate to manageable levels\n",
    "    - **#Vaccine**: includes general information and sentiment about different vaccines, or vaccines in general, during the pandemic\n",
    "    - **#Pfizer**: this is specific to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, capturing public sentiment around this particular vaccine\n",
    "    - **#Moderna**: this is specific to the Moderna vaccine, similarly capturing public sentiment about this vaccine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smaller Picture\n",
    "- For this project, I will focus on one hashtag: \"#SocialDistancing\""

    "**Step 2**: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "1. Pre-process Comments: Cleaned and tokenized the comments to remove any unnecessary characters, URLs, and stop words.\n",
    "2. Perform Sentiment Analysis: Used VADER to classify each comment as \"positive\", \"neutral\", or \"negative\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Data Visualization\n",
    "1. Pie Chart: Created a pie chart to display the percentage of positive, neutral, and negative comments for the hashtag.\n",
    "2. Bar Graph: Created a bar graph to show the distribution of sentiment scores.\n",
    "3. Word Cloud: Generate word clouds to visualize common words used in positive, neutral, and negative comments separately."
